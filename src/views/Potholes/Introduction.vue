    <p>
      The Streets Department provided the Controller's Office with data for more than
      100,000 street defect requests and nearly 300,000 repairs that occurred between
      January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2019. There are several different types of street
      defects, however the majority, about 80 percent, are potholes. The remaining
      defects are classified as cave-ins and utility ditches, which are generally more
      complicated to fix and can require additional work from a utility company. Not
      all repairs are the responsibility of the Streets Department. For example,
      defects near trolley lines must be repaired by SEPTA and defects on
      state-maintained roadways are fixed by PennDOT. Residents can report street
      defects to the Streets Department by calling 311 or 215-686-5560,

    <p>
      The Streets Department provided the Controller's Office with data for
      nearly 200,000 street defect requests and 270,000 repairs that occurred
      between January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2018. Residents can report street
      defects to the Streets Department by calling 311, 215-686-5560,
      <a

        target="blank_"
      >filling out an online form</a>, or by using the 311
      mobile app. Oftentimes, the Streets Department receives multiple requests
      for the same street defect. On the other hand, the Streets Department also
      repairs defects that have not been reported at all. The differences
      between defect repairs and requests across the city can be explored in
      more detail below.

    <p>Some quick facts about potholes and street defects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are
        <a
          href="https://www.philadelphiastreets.com/highways/potholes/"
          target="_blank"
        >several different types</a> of street defects. The
        majority, about 80 percent, are potholes. The remaining amount are
        classified as cave-ins and utility ditches, which are generally more
        complicated to fix and can require additional work from a utility
        company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not all repairs are the responsibility of the Streets Department. For example,
        defects near trolley lines must be repaired by SEPTA and defects on state-maintained
        roadways are fixed by PennDOT. These types of requests are automatically forwarded
        to the correct agency by the Streets Department.
      </li>
      <li>About 90 percent of reported potholes are repaired within 3 business days.</li>
      <li>
        Repairs typically peak during January, February, and March,
        as the freeze and thaw cycle of winter and spring is a significant contributor
        to the formation of new potholes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weather is the driving factor behind the fluctuations in the number
        of potholes each year. The overall health of the streets network, affected by
        the number of miles paved annually, also impacts the number of potholes that
        occur each year.
